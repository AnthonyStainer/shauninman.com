<h1>After reaching Agniratha</h1>



<p class="warning">Agniratha contains the cutoff for all quests pertaining to Mechonis Field.
(For My Loved One, To My Loved One, The History of Mechonis, Best Boots,
Monster Quest and both Challenge Quests from the Garrisoned Troop in Machina
Refuge, and A Weapon Just For Me.) Additionally, the cutoff for almost all of
the timed quests in the game that are not exclusive (meaning you pick between
two people) occurs shortly after you complete Agniratha. Quests for Agniratha
and Central Factory will remain available for a very brief time longer, but as
all quick travel points are locked out for those areas once you complete
Agniratha, it is my advice that you complete all timed quests you wish to do
prior to fighting the boss of Agniratha.

every single quest my advice to you would be to at least do the series of
quests that starts with Dangerous Ambition, as you'll get one final quest in
that storyline after the upcoming game events have finished that culminates in
fighting a Unique Monster you wouldn't get to see otherwise.
