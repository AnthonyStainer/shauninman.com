  	      One of the things I most look forward to when making a game is adding @8bitmatt's music and sound effects. I usually try to hold off as long as I can because the addition is always so reinvigorating. A bit like saving the best bite of your favorite meal for last.

  	      Whenever I tell someone I work in games their response is usually something along the lines of "that must be so much fun, playing games all day".

  	      The truth is for most of its development a game isn't much fun to play. It's just a silent, buggy piece of software standing between you and your vision for it. Only when it's fun is your work really done. And then you move onto the next one.

  	      I think the closest a dev can get to experiencing their own game as a first time player might is that moment, after months of toiling on mechanics and the mundane glue that holds it all together, they launch the game and are greeted by its title screen music.

  	      The variations of Master's Hands and the Astral theme offer a quiet and playful contrast to the various adventurous region themes, the driving energy of the dungeon theme Oubliette, and the mystery and dread of Crater.

  	      The one regret I have about the soundtrack is that I had to compress it so much to fit under the 100MB download limit. Fortunately @8bitmatt mixed and mastered every track in glorious stereo for the soundtrack releases. Yes, releases plural!

  	      (cues up A New Beginning) I hope you'll give it a listen and show @8bitmatt your support. And in case you missed it I also wrote a bit about Ratcheteer's production yesterday: <a href="https://shauninman.com/twitter/status/1544045481499697154">https://shauninman.com/twitter/status/1544045481499697154</a>
